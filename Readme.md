BlockReplacements
=================
Replaces blocks around your players when they get in range of configured blocks.  This should **NOT** be used in 
high traffic areas because it is not made to be resource friendly.  
Plugin Config
=============
Simply edit the existing list with \<from>:\<to>:\<radius> to change the behaviour. "from" is the value that you want to change, "to"
is the value to change it to, and "radius" is the radius you want the blocks to change in.
Disclaimer
==========
This plugin will not change blocks back on server crash/unsafe shutdowns(shutdowns that do not call the plugin's onDisable method.).  
**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR SERVER OR MAP/WORLD!**  
**PLEASE MAKE REGULAR BACKUPS BECAUSE THAT IS ALWAYS GOOD :D**
